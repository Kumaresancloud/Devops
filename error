Write a bash script using AWS CLI to identify all RDS instances missing a given tag (missing tag called “RPO”).  
The script should then generate a report in csv format with the following columns: 
•	AWS Account number 
•	AWS Region Name 
•	RDS Instance Identifier 
•	RDS Instance size 
 
Test Case 3: List S3 buckets where replication is enabled 
Use the lab account to perform the below using a bash script & aws cli 
1. Identify all s3 buckets where replication is enabled 
2. List only those buckets where the replication role is missing the AWS managed “S3FullAccess” policy 
3. Remediate such roles, identified in step 2, by attaching the S3FullAccess policy 
 
Test Case 4: Identify Load Balancers with HTTP Listeners 
Write script using bash and aws cli for the following: 
1. Identify all load balancers in the awsuat account that have only HTTP listeners 
2. Create a csv file with the following headers (and list LB attributes under those headers):  
                  Region, LB Name, app, bu, env, Security group id, number_of_targets 
3. Run this bash script using Jenkins (via Jenkinsfile) and email the csv file to your Guardian email address 
 
 
Test Case 5: Deploy test web application in the EKS cluster 
You can use the devops test eks cluster in the ‘awsuat’ account of Guardian for this test case. 
 
1. Create a namespace dev-nginx 
2. Create a deployment using replica set of size 2 using the nginx image within the custom namespace 
3. Create a service 
3. Deploy an ingress with Application Load Balancer within the custom namespace 
4. When accessing the name nginx-app.dev.aws.glic.com, confirm that the browser renders the standard nginx test page. 
5. Page should show "Hello to nginx!" in place of the default "Welcome to nginx!" 
6. Use devops cluster and nginx public image
