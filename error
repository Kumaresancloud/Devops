Warning: Reference to undefined provider
│
│   on main.tf line 10, in module "account_a_sns_publisher":
│   10:     aws = aws.account_a
│
│ There is no explicit declaration for local provider name "aws" in module.account_a_sns_publisher, so Terraform is assuming you mean to pass a configuration for "hashicorp/aws".
│
│ If you also control the child module, add a required_providers entry named "aws" with the source address "hashicorp/aws".
│
│ (and one more similar warning elsewhere)
